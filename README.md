The purpose of this project is to explore the capabilities of a simple three or more layer feed-forward neural network. This foray into neural computing is my final project for Introduction to Cognitive Science. Acknowledgements go to http://www.ai-junkie.com, where I found a very useful tutorial that the code here has been heavily based off of (including the test scenario for the networks themselves).

The instructions for the program are in the comments section of the params.py file, were all runtime user-configureable parameters are stored.
